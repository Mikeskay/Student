# Task Title: String Modification

# Task Description: 
This class defines the Student, with three attributes: name, email and year of registration to the
course.

The following methods with their functionality:

a) public void printList() - This method simply prints out each Student in the list.

b) public void addToList(Student s)- This method takes a Student object from the parameter and adds the given student to the list. Then print out a message to confirm “Name has been added to the list”.

c) public void removeFromList(Student s) - This method takes a Student object from the parameter and removes the given student from the list. Then print out a message to confirm “Name has been removed from the list”.

d) the main method by filling in the code to create object s3 with your own details.

Define a class, StudentMarks, which has an array attribute to hold seven double
values representing individual marks on seven assignments.

• Define an accessor getMarks() (but no mutator) for the array.

• Define methods to retrieve and set the marks for individual assignments at a given position (public double getMark(int pos) and public void
setMark(int pos, double mark))

• In addition, define a method to return the mean value of the seven marks.

• Write a class StudentMarksMain with a main method to set some sample
mark values via the class’s methods, and check that your class works properly.

The seven sample marks should be entered from the keyboard (use the
Scanner).

b) Add a further method to the StudentMarks class to return the index (position) of
the highest of the seven assignment marks held in the array. This method should
use a for loop to find the correct index.

c) In the class just written, which index is returned if there are two equal highest
marks for a student; that of the first or the second occurrence? Add a further
method so that the other occurrence is returned instead. Test both of these
methods.
